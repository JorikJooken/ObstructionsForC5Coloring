Use

./generateVertexCriticalGraphsC5Coloring -l8 17 < 30VertexGraph.g6

to generate all vertex-critical obstructions for C5-coloring P8-free graphs on at most 17 vertices.
The "30vertexGraph.g6" means that this particular graph on 30 vertices cannot occur as an induced subgraph.
This input argument cannot be empty (so the 30 vertex graph is a placeholder, because it will never occur).
You can also change it to a more realistic example, e.g. diamond.g6 to consider (P8,diamond)-free graphs.
